To install the development version of the project on your computer you have to perform the following steps:

1. Install `vagrant` on your computer
1. Install `VirtualBox` on your computer
1. Install `ansible` on your computer
1. Recommended on UNIX systems: Make sure you have `cowsay` installed
1. In your command line navigate into the `environment` directory in this project
1. run `vagrant up`
1. You should then be able to reach the API under api.perna.dev and see the documentation under doc.api.perna.dev

**Windows Users:** As ansible is not available for Windows, 
it will be installed in the virtual machine instead of your 
host computer. You do not have to do anything except for skipping step 3.
